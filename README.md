# Daily Journal

This website logs and updates journal entries rendering concepts covered and learned in NSS cohort 47. The journal allows for the logging of the date of the entry, concepts covered (a categorical designation), the entry itself, and general mood of the user. These entries will propogate in the lower half of the page.

## Languages Utilized

## How to Use
Within the form, the date of the entry, concept, the entry, and mood (dropdown) can all be filled out. Once each text field is filled out and dropdown selected, the 'record journal entry' will store the data on the json server. From the json, the data will propogate on the lower half of the page.
